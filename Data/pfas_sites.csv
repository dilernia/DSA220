Samples of storm water were collected at the facility in 2021 and 2022 as part of a Storm Water Characterization Study and PFOS was as high as 784 ppt (compared to 12 ppt) and copper as high as 0.70 milligrams per liter (mg/L). A thorough investigation of the storm water drainage system onsite led to the discovery of a faulty sump in the metal plating area of the facility, where plating solution was released into the soil, and then transported through the stormwater system via fractured piping in the subsurface. The source was subsequently isolated from the stormwater system, the fractured piping was replaced with closed PVC piping, and the sump was replaced. 

Lacks conducted a soil boring investigation throughout the plating area of the facility in October 2022 which included collecting soil samples for analysis of metals, hexavalent chromium, sulfate, chloride and PFAS. Analytical results identified elevated levels of chloride, sulfide, copper, selenium, and PFOS in soil within the vicinity of the replaced sump, with a maximum PFOS soil concentration of 180,000 ppt. A sediment sample collected at the storm water outfall south of the facility contained PFOS at a concentration of 840 ppt. There is no soil or sediment criteria.

In December 2022, EGLE Water Resources Division (WRD) sent a violation of outfall discharge permit notice to Lacks, and EGLE Remediation and Redevelopment Division (RRD) sent a compliance communication requesting compliance with Part 201 obligations for their facility. Lacks continued their investigation in July 2023 by collecting water samples from storm water catch basins and collecting groundwater samples adjacent to the storm water drain system to the north, west, and south of the facility. This sampling identified elevated concentrations of copper, chloride, PFOS and PFOA. The maximum concentration of PFOA in groundwater was 13 ppt (compared to 8 ppt) and the maximum concentration of PFOS in groundwater was 580 ppt (compared to 16 ppt). Additional investigations activities are expected to be conducted throughout 2024.

Groundwater flow is believed to be south toward the stormwater outfall, which empties into a tributary of Plaster Creek approximately 200 feet to the south of the outfall.","The area surrounding the Lacks Barden Plating facility is mainly industrial, with residential areas existing approximately 3,000 feet to the west of the site. The industrial and residential properties in the immediate vicinity of the site are serviced by municipal water. EGLE, DHHS, and Kent County Health Department identified one residential well nearby that is planned to be sampled.",EGLE will continue to oversee the response actions that Lacks is implementing to delineate the extent of the PFAS impacts in groundwater and surface water and mitigate any potential public health risks at the site.

When PFAS was first detected at low levels in one of the wells - called the Clarkston Gardens Well, the well was taken offline and no longer used as a source of drinking water. In 2020, an additional well - Chestnut Hills Well - area had low level detections of PFAS and was also taken offline.  
In the spring of 2023, the Township reached out to MPART to help coordinate sampling of shallow groundwater and residential wells near the Ben Powell/Clarkston Landfill (which was in operation from the 1940s to 1978).  Groundwater sampling was conducted at several locations near the landfill and the highest result was 21 ppt PFOA (compared to 16 ppt).  In February 2024, the originally posted Independence Township Area of Interest became an official MPART site because of exceedances in groundwater and the landfill being determined to be the source of PFAS contamination.
Groundwater is assumed to flow to the south/southwest towards Park Lake.  
","Municipal water is available in portions of the Township.  In 2023, the Township received $5.4 million in funding to extend watermains to homes in the affected area.  Construction is slated to begin in Fall 2024.  The Township is in the planning phase for additional water main extensions for PFAS mitigation for FY25.
In April 2023, the Township hired an engineering consultant to sample private drinking water wells, starting with homes closest to the landfill.  Residential well sampling was conducted in several phases and considered other potential sources of PFAS in the area.  Forty-four (44) residential wells were sampled, six (6) of which had detections below the drinking water criteria; the rest of which were non-detect. Independence Township met with EGLE, DHHS, and local health department staff after each phase of the investigation to discuss results and next steps.
Some residents will be connected to municipal water as part of infrastructure projects that were and currently being planned for.  These projects will include all of the homes that had detections of PFAS in their drinking water well.
","A small subset of samples will be collected, in addition to the original 44 samples to be re-sampled in Spring 2024.

The Township will also be researching potential locations for new drinking water wells due to the Clarkston Gardens and Chestnut Hills being taken offline.

The manufacturing plant produces paper pulp and is adjacent to a warehouse where post-consumer recycled material was stored for use in the manufacturing process. On October 6, 2022, a large-scale industrial fire at the adjoining warehouse owned by KK Integrated Logistics and further impacted portions of the warehouse occupied by ChemDesign and Tyco/Johnson Controls. The adjoining warehouse contained numerous containers of chemicals, including Class B firefighting foam known to contain PFAS. Firefighting teams and incident management agencies responded, including Wisconsin, Michigan, and the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). Water was initially used to fight the fire, but as the fire continued, a Class A foam was used to aid in firefighting operations. The fire was completely extinguished by October 20, 2022.
Early on, some firefighting water entered the river, which was a concern because the river flows into Green Bay, which is where the drinking water intakes are located for the cities of Menominee, Michigan and Marinette, Wisconsin. Earth berms were installed quickly onsite and large holding tanks were mobilized to contain most of the fire water during continued firefighting operations. Over 5.5 million gallons of firewater were captured onsite in a combination of frac tanks, a large constructed bermed pond, and constructed holding tanks. Water contained in the pond was later pumped into holding tanks and the pond was deconstructed. In early November 2022, a treatment system was constructed onsite to treat the water in the holding tanks before it was discharged into the river or pumped to the Menominee Wastewater Treatment Plant for additional treatment.

During firefighting operations, sampling for PFAS occurred at the Menominee Water Treatment Plant (which serves drinking water to nearby residents in Menominee, Michigan), the Menominee Wastewater Treatment Plant, the Marinette Water Treatment and Wastewater Treatment systems, and along the Menominee River. EGLE, the City of Menominee, Michigan, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR), the City of Marinette, Wisconsin, and local health departments from both states coordinated efforts to sample surface water in the Menominee River, the ""raw"" lake water (the water going into the water treatment plant) and ""treated water"" (water that comes out of the water treatment plant used for drinking water) during and following the fire response.  

Fire debris, including paper waste and pulp, was transported to one of two solid waste landfills in Michigan and Wisconsin. As of November 11, 2022, over 36,000 tons of fire debris material had been transported off site. Firefighting foam that was compromised and spilled within a portion of the impacted warehouse was vacuumed into containers and transported to a waste facility in Oregon for disposal. Waste was characterized before transport and disposal.

","From 2021 through 2023, under a separate investigation, nearby residential wells and public drinking water wells were sampled for PFAS in the vicinity of the former Anderson Landfill due to two dewatering projects on Eight Mile Road and Nine Mile Road that staff were concerned could change groundwater flow and impact nearby drinking water wells.  Drinking water wells were sampled for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and PFAS, and the results were non-detect.  In 2022, public drinking water wells at ITC Park, Maybury State Park, and Little Seeds Northville Day Care were sampled for PFAS.  Results were non-detect, excluding a drinking water well at Oak Trail in Maybury State Park.  The Oak Trail well had detections of PFOA at 6 ppt and 8 ppt (compared to 8 ppt), and the detections were determined to be unrelated to the landfill. The DNR has taken the well out of service. 

To the east of the Anderson Landfill is an area slated to become a new subdivision.   In September through October of 2023, the developer, Parc Vista installed a dewatering system to lower the water table to facilitate the construction and connection of a sanitary sewer system to the main sanitary line located in the Eight Mile Road right-of-way (ROW).  During dewatering activities, four monitoring wells were installed in the Eight Mile Road ROW for sampling purposes and to measure groundwater elevations.  These monitoring wells and the dewatering discharge location along Eight Mile Road were sampled weekly for PFAS.  Analytical results indicated that PFAS results were non-detect for all samples in all locations. Parc Vista will restrict groundwater usage due to the PFAS detections from the former landfill.  Drinking water will be supplied by Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA).

The property west of the former landfill, Former Holloway Sand & Gravel, was purchased by the City of Novi in early 2024. The City submitted a BEA, but no additional PFAS sampling was conducted by the City.  EGLE conducted groundwater sampling in the summer of 2024 and will conduct additional sampling in the fall 2024.
",EGLE will be sampling at the Former Holloway Sand & Gravel in the fall 2024 to determine if PFAS from the landfill is migrating off-site to the west.

The airport had two historical known areas where AFFF was used. Approximately 50 gallons of AFFF was used in training exercises that took place along the old runway. In 1992 there was a plane crash that occurred on the concrete area near the new terminal, and 200-300 gallons of AFFF was used. The MDOT grant was used to sample surface water and deep groundwater.

In 2022, the airport was awarded another PFAS grant from EGLE to continue investigating groundwater impacts.  In September 2023, the airports contractor collected 17 groundwater samples from various monitoring wells installed at the airport.  Groundwater from seven monitoring wells were above criteria.  The highest results were 41,000 ppt PFHxS (compared to 51 ppt), 14,000 ppt PFOS (compared to 16 ppt), and 3,500 ppt PFOA (compared to 8 ppt).  EGLE received the report with the results from the airport in April 2024.

Because the site has PFAS above groundwater clean-up criteria, in September 2024, the Area of Interest was reclassified to an official MPART site.

The regional groundwater flow was inferred to be to the northeast.  Shallow groundwater flows to the southeast. Potentially impacted waterbodies are the North Branch Squaconning Creek and the West Branch Squaconning Creek, both which flow into the Saginaw River.

This property operated as the Nankin Township Landfill from approximately 1957 to approximately 1962. Based on aerial photographs, it appears to have been used as a landfill in the 1940s and 1950s as well. While operating as the Nankin Township Landfill, municipal and industrial waste were accepted, including industrial waste from 3M, a known PFAS manufacturer. The EPA performed a cleanup at the site in 1994-1995, removing 5,000 cubic yards of industrial waste and 350 waste drums. There is an exposure barrier currently in place to keep landfill materials from resurfacing and a creek erosion barrier that also acts as an exposure barrier. These barriers are inspected and maintained by Wayne County. A portion of this former dump site is a part of the Wayne County Parks system and includes a recreational hiking trail along Tonquish Creek, which is located on the northern and western boundaries of the site.

After a site file review, EGLE decided to investigate this site for PFAS based on the site historically accepting industrial waste from known PFAS manufacturer, 3M. In September 2024, EGLE installed seven groundwater monitoring wells and in October 2024, groundwater and surface water samples were collected from the site and analyzed. Results indicated that various PFAS compounds are present in the groundwater and surface water.
